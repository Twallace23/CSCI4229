To run the Program is very easy, Default viewing mode is First Person, When you toggle view modes the arrow keys are needed to change camera angle for proper viewing. When view mode is changed from first person camera of world may be flipped this error was happening infrequently, but using the up and down arrow keys will fix.

I have finished my football scene! I have 11 players on offense and defense aligned as they would be in a football game. I am really proud about how the people objects turned out this was definitely the hardest part of the project. One of my favorite personal touches was the little gatorade jug that I created I also like the little injury table inside of the tent its very subtle and awesome in my opinion.
