HW6: Textures and Lighting

Tayvian Wallace
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2022


Adding on to the football Scene I added the other goal post adding a rough
steel texture to both posts. I also added some grass texture to the field. 
I spent about 5.5 hours on this assignment. I was having issues converting jpeg to bmp
to meet the conditions of the loader.
