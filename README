HW3: Objects

I am attempting to create a Star object and the preliminary shape for my goal posts. I would like to keep adding to this scene with the hopes of creating a football game. I had some issues trying to create additional instances of my star, I think it has something to do with how I declared my function. I think that I need to append my function. I would like to come to office hours this week to discuss. I spent around 5 hours trying to complete the assignment.
